                            My face painting journey began unexpectedly when I filled in for an artist at my husband's workplace. From that moment, I became obsessed with paint, colour, and creating unique combinations, leading to the one-stroke. While raising three young kids, I practised constantly, turning weekend party gigs into a career. Eventually, I partnered with Fusion to design my own palettes, brushes, and stencils. Now, I teach worldwide, attend conventions, and host masterclasses; sharing the joy of face painting with everyone. I love helping fellow art and paint enthusiasts, which is why I created these kits to make it easy for anyone to get started.
